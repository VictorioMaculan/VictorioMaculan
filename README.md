# About me ðŸ™‚
I'm VictÃ³rio Maculan, I'm 14 years old and I was born here in Brazil. I started programming when I was 13 years old, as a hobby and I still do it a lot, because
I really enjoy it.

I'm one of those guys who enjoys math and all this stuff that involves numbers, and that's why I'm really interested in Data Science.

My other hobbies are reading, playing chess, writing, and sometimes making small paintings.

I can speak Portuguese, English, and a little Spanish, so if you want to talk, just send me a message!
